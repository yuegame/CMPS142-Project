Notes:
 - nltk has naive Bayes and a buncha other useful ML stuff

Preprocessing:

Tokenize words in phrase to run through naive Bayes:
 - ignore punctuation
 - combine abbreviations into one word

Use KNN on phraseID and sentenceID to come up with classification:
 - if results are decisively one label, factor that with naive Bayes
 - if not, discard result and only use naive Bayes result
